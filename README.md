## [Build a Recommender System: Movie Rating Prediction](https://github.com/zren15/Advanced-Machine-Learning/blob/master/recommender%20system/recommender_system.ipynb)
- Leverage users’ and movies’ affinity with certain latent characteristics to predict rating that a user would give to a movie.

## [PyTorch: Image classification](https://github.com/zren15/Advanced-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Neural%20Networks%20for%20MNIST%20dataset/MNIST_report.ipynb)
- Apply 2-Layer and 3-Layer neural networks for the task of handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset with 98.2% accuracy rate.

## [Predict if an email is a spam: Implement AdaBoost & Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) & Boosting Neural Network](https://github.com/zren15/Advanced-Machine-Learning/blob/master/spam%20email%20classification/spam_report.ipynb)

- Write a program implementing AdaBoost with trees and train a decision tree classifier with weights. Compare AdaBoost and XGBoost methods to predict if an email is a spam with 96% accuracy rate.
- Implement Boosting of neural networks for classifying spam/not spam emails with 80% accuracy rate.

## [Predict New York Rent Price dataset by implementing Gradient Boosting for MSE](https://github.com/zren15/Advanced-Machine-Learning/blob/master/new%20york%20rent%20prediction/Predict%20New%20York%20Rent%20Price.ipynb) 
- Write a program from scratch implementing gradient boosting from MSE.
- Fix the Shrinkage to 0.1. Apply gradient boosting to the New York rent price dataset with **over 48,000 rows** using different values for the number of trees numTrees.
- Compare the Gradient Boosting for MSE results with the results of running the gradient boosting package (XGBoost). Explore the hyper parameters given in the package.

## [Named Entity Recognition (NER)](https://github.com/zren15/Advanced-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Name%20Entity%20Recognition/ner_report.ipynb)
- Implement a Sliding Window Neural Network model for Named Entity Recognition with 90.9% accuracy score.
